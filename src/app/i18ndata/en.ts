An efficient boiler is more environmentally friendly leading to gas consumption, therefore lowering your bills. The safety aspect is even more critical as a regularly serviced boiler will operate safely i.e. the gas will burn correctly, reducing the rish of emissions of poisonous Carbon Monoxide and / production of soot.'
